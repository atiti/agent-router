# Changelog

## 0.5.17 — 2026-09-18

- Make routing work in non-interactive `codex exec` sessions by registering the exact AgentRoute
  hooks in Codex's trust store during setup.
- Ask Codex's own app-server for canonical hook hashes and trust only matching AgentRoute commands;
  never bypass trust globally or authorize unrelated user/project hooks.
- Fail installation visibly when the routed runtime cannot discover or persist both required hooks.

## 0.5.16 — 2026-09-17

- Add checksum-verified prebuilt release installation and in-place updates.
- Add local Codex Desktop install, rebuild, status, and rollback commands without redistributing
  ChatGPT.app.
- Surface the selected route in Codex Desktop and preserve the compatible Codex app-server version.
- Add multi-platform release builds, provenance attestations, optional Apple Developer ID signing,
  and a manual release gate.
- Add weekly upstream Codex patch/compile checks with actionable compatibility issues.
- Add packaging, archive-safety, Desktop rollback, wheel-content, and patch-stack validation.
